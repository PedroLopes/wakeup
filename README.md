wakeup
======
Wakeup script that plays soothing music, reads out your day's agenda from google cal, plays your yoga tutorial video and has a nice chat with you. 

notes
===
Was developed for very personal use, means that it does more than you might need. But then again it is open code that you can use for your own ideas. 

installing it
===
This is python code. You need python.

simply: ./install_deps.sh
then: pip install -r requirements.txt
You should now have everything to run this.
