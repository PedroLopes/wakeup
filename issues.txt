1. can't handle all day events
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "wakeup.py", line 113, in <module>
    timestamp = feed.date.rfc3339.tf_from_timestamp(next_event_time['dateTime'])
KeyError: 'dateTime'
solution: probe if its all day, if so ignore

2. not sure what happens with concurrent events, i.e., same start time 
solution: pick up all events that start at same time and say all, max 3.
